# Word day Scheduler by Ignacio Diaz

This is the 5th homework I have done during my period in Monash bootcamp. I have developed an app where user can have a daily schedule and make notes of what they are going to be doing within user's work hours.

I have use momentJS library to be able to work on time and dates. https://www.momnemtjs.com/

To develop most Javascript code I have used JQuery.
